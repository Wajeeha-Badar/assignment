let name13: string = ("allama iqbal");

// step 1 lower case
let lowerCaseName : string = name13.toLowerCase();
console.log(lowerCaseName);
//step 2 upper case

// 4: Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:
console.log("Allama Iqbal once said,'Destiny is the prison and chain of the ignorant.' ");
//5: Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 4, but this time store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.
let famousPerson1:string = ("Allama Iqbal"); 
let message1:string= famousPerson1 +" once said, 'The ultimate aim of the ego is not to see something, but to be something'";
console.log(message1);
//Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so  the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
